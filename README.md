# CRUD Todo List

## Intent

This project is based on the youtube tutorial that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpJO0T08Bnc).

It is inteded to explore CRUD operations using Apollo, GraphQL & React. Basic styling was done using Material UI for React.JS.

## Usage

First go into the server directory and start the localhost graphQL server, this will run on port 4000.

To start: 
`node index.js`

Then on another shell go into your client folder and run the following command:

`npm start`

This will start your localhost client server and should display your app on a new browser window. 

Note: The client server usually runs on port 3000 but will ask you if you allow a new port if port 3000 is busy.

## Technologies used

- React.Js
- Apollo (react-apollo)
- GraphQL (qraphql-tag)
- Material UI
